Celtic-Bit Pixel Font
Font designed and created by Mirz (Michelle Lehmann)
=====================================

This package contains 3 fonts. The main Celtic-Bit font which
was created to replicate the brush strokes used in medieval/
calligraphic writing.  The second is Celtic-Bit Thin, which
is simply the same font, but with a more traditional pixel-
font look.  The last font is Celtic-Bitty which is a smaller
condensed version of the font--the difference being that some 
letters have been replaced with more easily-read modern versions 
of the renditions.

This font is best used at 6pt/8px in most graphic programs.
